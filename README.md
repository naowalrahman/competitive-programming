# Competitive Programming Solutions
This repository is used to store files of code that I have for competitive programming problems, or files that I am creating as I learn a certain concept or langauge. 

It is not dedicated to a particular project, but rather as a store for files of code that I use on multiple machines, so as to allow synchronization. 

## Setting up `git` for easy access
```sh
git config --global user.name "Naowal Rahman"
git config --global user.email "naowal.ar@gmail.com" 
git config --global credential.helper cache
```

## Cloning the repository for synchronization
```sh
git clone https://github.com/naowalrahman/other-files.git
```
